### pontos_turisticos
It is a project that creates an API RESTful for tourist attractions, with comments, ratings, address, etc. The objective of this project is to apply basics and intermediate concepts on [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). The architecture of this application can be generalized for pretty much any other small CRUD-like application and it is a good option to be used as example project.
